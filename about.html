            The company started in Trenton, NJ. However, as business grew, the company began to expand throughout the New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York area.<br><br>
            The company was sold to Interstate Outdoor in 2000 and is no longer around, but many photos are available and show the company's large influence over the Trenton area.

                The R.C. Maxwell Company was founded by Robert Chester Maxwell (1873 - 1955) in 1894, and operated for just over a century until it was eventually sold in the year 2000.<br><br>
                The R.C. Maxwell Company was one of the earliest enduring advertising companies of its time. The company designed billboard displays for various companies, including Coca-Cola and Wrigley's. The billboards were originally placed along railroad tracks. However, as automobiles became a more common form of transportation, billboards began to appear more frequently within cities and towns, contributing to the success of the company. In addition to designing billboards, the R.C. Maxwell Company also designed signs to raise awareness for World War 1 support efforts, the U.S. Food Administration, and the U.S. Fuel Administration. Furthermore, the Company participated in various parades, including the popular Miss America Beauty Pageant Parade.
