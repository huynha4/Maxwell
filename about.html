                <p><u>When:</u> The Company was Founded in 1894, and operated for just over a century until it was eventually sold in the year 2000.</br></br>
                <u>Founder:</u> Robert Chester Maxwell (1873 - 1955)</br></br>
                <u>Where:</u> The Company started in Trenton, NJ. However, as business grew, the company began to expand throughout New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York area.</br></br>
                <u>About:</u> The R.C. Maxwell Company was one of the earliest enduring advertising companies of its time. The company designed billboard displays for various companies, including Coca-Cola and Wrigley's. The billboards were originally placed along railroad tracks. However, as automobiles became a more common form of transportation, billboards began to appear more frequently within cities and towns, contributing to the success of the company. In addition to designing billboards, the R.C. Maxwell Company also designed signs to raise awareness for World War 1 support efforts, the U.S. Food Administration, and the U.S. Fuel Administration. Furthermore, the Company participated in various parades, including the popular Miss America Beauty Pageant Parade.</p>
